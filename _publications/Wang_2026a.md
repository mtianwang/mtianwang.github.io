Young exoplanets provide vital insights into the early dynamical and atmospheric evolution of planetary systems. Many multi-planet systems younger than 100 Myr exhibit mean-motion resonances, likely established through convergent disk migration. Over time, however, these resonant chains are often disrupted, mirroring the Nice model proposed for the Solar System. We present a detailed characterization of the ~200-Myr-old TOI-2076 system, which contains four sub-Neptune planets between 1.4 and 3.5 Earth radii. We demonstrate that its planets are near but not locked in mean-motion resonances, making the system dynamically fragile. The four planets have comparable core masses but display a monotonic increase in hydrogen and helium (H/He) envelope mass fractions (stripped-1%-5%-5%) with decreasing stellar insolation. This trend is consistent with atmospheric mass-loss due to photoevaporation, which predicts that the envelopes of irradiated planets either erode completely or stabilize at a residual level of $\sim$1\% by mass within the first few hundred million years, with more distant, less-irradiated planets retaining most of primordial envelopes. Additionally, previous detections of metastable helium outflows rule out a pure water-world scenario for TOI-2076 planets. Our finding provides direct observational evidence that the dynamical and atmospheric reshaping of compact planetary systems begin early, offering an empirical anchor for models of their long-term evolution.
