Hello! I am Mutian Wang (王牧天). I am a graduate student in Astronomy at Nanjing University, China. I work on the formation and dynamical evolution of exoplanetary systems with Prof. Huigen Liu. My research focuses on the orbital architectures of young and near-resonant planetary systems, as well as circumbinary planets, using photodynamical modeling and radial-velocity data. By combining observations from space- and ground-based facilities with numerical simulations and theoretical groundings, I aim to understand how planetary systems acquire, modify, and preserve their orbital configurations across different evolutionary stages. Before my PhD During 2024.11-2025.11, I was a visiting student at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, working with Prof. Fei Dai.
